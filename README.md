# HomeMonitor

This project aims to end up as a lightweight service that runs on a Raspberry Pi. 

It will take in data from a connected webcam, capturing regular images and also detecting any motion.

Another goal is to implement a RESTful API that also runs on the Raspberry Pi, initially the API will simply return the path to images stored server side - this will allow the Android project I am creating alongside this to gather the latest images and display them.
